Born on the same day, in very different situations, they meet years later, united by coincidences that go beyond their birthday. From humble origins, Viola moves with her boyfriend Mavi to Angra dos Reis, where Luma lives a luxurious life and dates Rudá, who ends up meeting Viola by chance. Thus begins the duo's journey, which goes from a passion for recipes to an obsession with the same man, from the immediate connection to the point of starting to live their friend’s reality, 10 years later. A journey divided between complicity and rivalry, which includes them in a love quadrangle and is impacted by a series of circumstances, twists and surprises, such as the secret surrounding a murder.</div><h3>TV Show Details:</h3><table class="table table-bordered details"><tr><th>Name</th><td>Crazy About You</td></tr><tr><th>Original Name</th><td>Mania de Você</td></tr><tr><th>First Air Date</th><td>2024-09-09</td></tr><tr><th>Last Air Date</th><td>2025-02-08</td></tr><tr><th>Genre</th><td>Soap, Drama, Mystery</td></tr><tr><th>Status</th><td>Returning Series</td></tr><tr><th>Production Countries</th><td>Brazil</td></tr><tr><th>Origin Countries</th><td>BR</td></tr><tr><th>Spoken Languages</th><td>pt</td></tr><tr><th>Rating</th><td>5.4</td></tr><tr><th>Vote Count</th><td>13</td></tr><tr><th>Production Companies</th><td>Estúdios Globo</td></tr><tr><th>Popularity</th><td>1852.707</td></tr><tr><th>Original Language</th><td>PT</td></tr><tr><th>TV Show ID</th><td>237478</td></tr><tr><th>Homepage</th><td>https://gshow.globo.com/novelas/mania-de-voce</td></tr></table><h3>Cast:</h3><ul class="list-group cast"><li>Gabz as Viola</li><li>Agatha Moreira as Luma</li><li>Chay Suede as Mavi</li><li>Nicolas Prattes as Rudá</li><li>Adriana Esteves as Mércia</li><li>Mariana Ximenes as Ísis</li><li>Eliane Giardini as Berta</li><li>Jaffar Bambirra as Iberê</li><li>Leonardo Bittencourt as Rhodes</li><li>Ângelo Antônio as Nahum</li><li>Bukassa Kabengele as Marcel</li><li>Ana Beatriz Nogueira as Moema</li><li>Thalita Carauta as Leidi</li><li>David Junior as Sirley</li><li>Alanis Guillen as Michele</li><li>Samuel de Assis as Daniel</li><li>Bruno Montaleone as Cristiano</li><li>Mariana Santos as Fátima</li><li>Eriberto Leão as Robson</li><li>Paulo Rocha as Volney</li><li>Vanessa Bueno as Diana</li><li>Danilo Grangheia as Hugo</li><li>Duda Batsow as Bruna</li><li>Paulo Mendes as Tomás</li><li>Gi Fernandes as Evelyn</li><li>Igor Cosso as Gael</li><li>Érico Brás as Edmilson</li><li>Ivy Souza as Dhu</li><li>Bruno Quixote as Wagner</li><li>Lucas Wickhaus as Iarley</li><li>Liza Del Dala as Lorena</li></ul><h3>Credits:</h3><ul class="list-group crew"><li>Márcia Prates - Co-Writer</li><li>Marina Luisa - Co-Writer</li><li>Carlos Araújo - Art Direction</li><li>Philippe Barcinski - Director</li><li>Lucas Zardo - Producer</li><li>Marta Rangel - Researcher</li><li>Gustavo Rebelo - Producer</li><li>João Emanuel Carneiro - Writer</li><li>Isabella Teixeira - Director</li><li>Noa Bressane - Director</li><li>Zé Dassilva - Co-Writer</li><li>Guilherme Azevedo - Director</li><li>Eliane Garcia - Co-Writer</li><li>Igor Verde - Director</li><li>Anitta - Theme Song Performance</li><li>Vincent Villari - Co-Writer</li></ul>
