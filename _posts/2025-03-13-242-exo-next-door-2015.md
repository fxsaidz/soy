One day, four young men move into the house right next door to Yeon-hee's home, and to her surprise, they turn out to be Chanyeol, D.O, Baekhyun, and Sehun from her favorite boy band EXO, who are looking to lay low for a while. They hire her to clean their house part-time during the winter vacation and that's when Yeon-hee found out that Chanyeol was her long lost childhood friend and crush "Chan" and is the grandson of the house owner. As the story goes on, Yeon-hee soon becomes involved in a love triangle with Chanyeol and D.O.</div><h3>TV Show Details:</h3><table class="table table-bordered details"><tr><th>Name</th><td>EXO Next Door</td></tr><tr><th>Original Name</th><td>우리 옆집에 엑소가 산다</td></tr><tr><th>First Air Date</th><td>2015-04-09</td></tr><tr><th>Last Air Date</th><td>2015-05-28</td></tr><tr><th>Episode Runtime</th><td>15 min</td></tr><tr><th>Genre</th><td>Comedy, Drama</td></tr><tr><th>Status</th><td>Ended</td></tr><tr><th>Production Countries</th><td>South Korea</td></tr><tr><th>Origin Countries</th><td>KR</td></tr><tr><th>Spoken Languages</th><td>ko</td></tr><tr><th>Rating</th><td>8.151</td></tr><tr><th>Vote Count</th><td>159</td></tr><tr><th>Tagline</th><td>EXO Lives Next Door to my House</td></tr><tr><th>Production Companies</th><td>Oh!Boy Project</td></tr><tr><th>Popularity</th><td>3.542</td></tr><tr><th>Original Language</th><td>KO</td></tr><tr><th>TV Show ID</th><td>64127</td></tr><tr><th>Homepage</th><td>http://tvcast.naver.com/lineexonextdoor</td></tr></table><h3>Cast:</h3><ul class="list-group cast"><li>Chanyeol as Chanyeol</li><li>Mun Ka-young as Ji Yeon-hee</li><li>Doh Kyung-soo as D.O</li><li>Baekhyun as Baekhyun</li><li>Sehun as Sehun</li><li>Jang Yoo-sang as Ji Gwang-soo</li><li>Jeon Soo-jin as Ga-eun</li><li>Kim Hee-jung as Ji Yeon-hee's mother</li><li>Yun Ju-Sang as Chan-yeol's grandfather</li><li>Kai as Kai</li><li>Suho as Suho</li><li>Zhang Yixing as Lay</li><li>Xiumin as Xiumin</li><li>Chen as Chen</li><li>Huang Zitao as Tao</li><li>Jeong Si-hyun as Min Hwan</li><li>Han Seo-jin as Ji Yeon-Hee [Young]</li></ul><h3>Credits:</h3><ul class="list-group crew"><li>Lee Kwon - Director</li><li>Baekhyun - Theme Song Performance</li></ul>
