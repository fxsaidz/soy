Now, she’s figuring out the duties of a deity with the help of Tomoe, a reformed fox demon who reluctantly becomes her familiar in a contract sealed with a kiss. The new responsibilities—and boys—are a lot to handle, like the crow demon masquerading as a gorgeous pop idol and the adorable snake spirit who’s chosen the newly minted god to be his bride. As the headstrong Tomoe tries to whip her into shape, Nanami finds that love just might have cute, pointed fox ears. With romance in the air, will the human deity be able to prove herself worthy of her new title?</div><h3>TV Show Details:</h3><table class="table table-bordered details"><tr><th>Name</th><td>Kamisama Kiss</td></tr><tr><th>Original Name</th><td>神様はじめました</td></tr><tr><th>First Air Date</th><td>2012-10-02</td></tr><tr><th>Last Air Date</th><td>2015-03-30</td></tr><tr><th>Episode Runtime</th><td>24 min</td></tr><tr><th>Genre</th><td>Animation, Comedy, Sci-Fi & Fantasy</td></tr><tr><th>Status</th><td>Ended</td></tr><tr><th>Production Countries</th><td>Japan</td></tr><tr><th>Origin Countries</th><td>JP</td></tr><tr><th>Spoken Languages</th><td>ja</td></tr><tr><th>Rating</th><td>8.652</td></tr><tr><th>Vote Count</th><td>931</td></tr><tr><th>Production Companies</th><td>TMS Entertainment, V1 studio</td></tr><tr><th>Popularity</th><td>5.102</td></tr><tr><th>Original Language</th><td>JA</td></tr><tr><th>TV Show ID</th><td>62741</td></tr><tr><th>Homepage</th><td>http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/kamisama/</td></tr></table><h3>Cast:</h3><ul class="list-group cast"><li>Yui Horie as Numa no Himemiko (voice)</li><li>Suzuko Mimori as Nanami Momozono (voice)</li><li>Daisuke Namikawa as Sukuna Ryuuou (voice)</li><li>Daisuke Kishio as Kurama (voice)</li><li>Satomi Sato as Ami Nekota (voice)</li><li>Vanilla Yamazaki as Narrator (voice)</li><li>Yu Kobayashi as Isohime (voice)</li><li>Shuta Morishima as Isobe (voice)</li><li>Akira Ishida as Mikage (voice)</li><li>Akemi Okamura as Kamehime (voice)</li><li>Shinnosuke Tachibana as Tomoe (voice)</li><li>Nobuhiko Okamoto as Mizuki (voice)</li><li>Natsuyo Atarashi as Onikiri (voice)</li><li>Chika Ookubo as Kotetsu (voice)</li><li>Hiroki Takahashi as Otohiko (voice)</li></ul><h3>Credits:</h3><ul class="list-group crew"><li>Manami Watanabe - Associate Producer</li><li>Kayoko Nishi - Color Designer</li><li>Akitaro Daichi - Director</li><li>Akitaro Daichi - Screenplay</li><li>Ikumi Hayashi - Producer</li><li>Julietta Suzuki - Comic Book</li></ul>
