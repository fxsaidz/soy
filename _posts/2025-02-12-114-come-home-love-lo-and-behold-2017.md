His only concern now are his three daughters. His eldest daughter has immigrated overseas. His second daughter Hung Yeuk Shui has reached the marriageable age, but has no hopes for marriage anytime soon. She is constantly bickering with her younger sister Hung Sum Yue, who is an honour student, over trivial matters, causing their father to not know whether to laugh or cry. Hung Sue Yan, Hung Sue Gan's brother, moves in with the family, temporarily ending his life as a nomadic photographer. He joins Hung Yeuk Shui's company and encounters Ko Pak Fei, the director of an online shop. The two appear to be former lovers, making for lots of laughter. Since Hung Sue Yan moved in, a series of strange events have occurred in the family. Upon investigation, the source is traced to Lung Ging Fung, a promising young man who is the son of department store mogul Lung Gam Wai.</div><h3>TV Show Details:</h3><table class="table table-bordered details"><tr><th>Name</th><td>Come Home Love: Lo and Behold</td></tr><tr><th>Original Name</th><td>愛·回家之開心速遞</td></tr><tr><th>First Air Date</th><td>2017-02-06</td></tr><tr><th>Last Air Date</th><td>2024-12-27</td></tr><tr><th>Episode Runtime</th><td>22 min</td></tr><tr><th>Genre</th><td>Family, Comedy, Drama</td></tr><tr><th>Status</th><td>Returning Series</td></tr><tr><th>Production Countries</th><td>Hong Kong</td></tr><tr><th>Origin Countries</th><td>HK</td></tr><tr><th>Spoken Languages</th><td>cn</td></tr><tr><th>Rating</th><td>5.357</td></tr><tr><th>Vote Count</th><td>42</td></tr><tr><th>Production Companies</th><td>TVB</td></tr><tr><th>Popularity</th><td>2266.137</td></tr><tr><th>Original Language</th><td>CN</td></tr><tr><th>TV Show ID</th><td>91759</td></tr><tr><th>Homepage</th><td>https://www.mytvsuper.com/en/programme/loandbehold_110561/Lo-And-Behold/</td></tr></table><h3>Cast:</h3><ul class="list-group cast"><li>Lau Dan as Hung Shu-kan</li><li>Angela Tong Ying-Ying as Ko Pak-fei</li><li>Koni Lui as Hung Yeuk-shui</li><li>Pal Sinn Lap-Man as Hung Shu-yan</li><li>Andrea So as Hung Shum-yu</li><li>Joyce Tang Lai-Ming as Hung Sheung-sin</li><li>Kalok Chow as Kam Shing-on</li><li>Iris Lam Hoi Yan as 譚育英（Bonnie）</li><li>Law Lok-Lam as Lung Gam-wai</li><li>Ricco Ng as Chu Ling-ling</li><li>Mark Ma as Qin Bosi</li><li>Maggie Leung Man-Hau as 谭何容仪 (少女)</li><li>Lesley Chiang as </li><li>Stanley Cheung as Gong Yip 'Industry'</li><li>Andrew Yuen as Chiu Wai</li><li>Li Wai Kin as Terry Lung Lik-wong</li><li>Mandy Lam as Linda Lung Lik-lin</li><li>Hoffman Cheng as Max Lung Lik-si</li><li>Andrew Chan as Lung Ging-fung</li><li>Jimmy Au Shui-Wai as Ng Ka Chung 'KC'</li><li>Jack Hui Ka Kit as Song Shui-fei</li></ul><h3>Credits:</h3><ul class="list-group crew"><li>Ma Jun Ying - Writer</li><li>Yuan Bao Hui - Writer</li><li>Anna Lee - Writer</li><li>Luo Zhen Yue - Director</li></ul>
