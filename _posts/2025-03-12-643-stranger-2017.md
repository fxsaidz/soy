Hwang becomes a prosecutor known for his piercing intelligence and logic, but he is ostracized because he lacks empathy and social skills. He is also one of only a handful of upright prosecutors who have refused to take bribes. One day, he encounters a stabbing victim while investigating corruption. He meets Lieutenant Han Yeo Jin at the crime scene. They join forces to root out corruption at the prosecutors’ office and solve a serial murder case.</div><h3>TV Show Details:</h3><table class="table table-bordered details"><tr><th>Name</th><td>Stranger</td></tr><tr><th>Original Name</th><td>비밀의 숲</td></tr><tr><th>First Air Date</th><td>2017-06-10</td></tr><tr><th>Last Air Date</th><td>2020-10-04</td></tr><tr><th>Episode Runtime</th><td>69 min</td></tr><tr><th>Genre</th><td>Crime, Drama, Mystery</td></tr><tr><th>Status</th><td>Ended</td></tr><tr><th>Production Countries</th><td>South Korea</td></tr><tr><th>Origin Countries</th><td>KR</td></tr><tr><th>Spoken Languages</th><td>ko</td></tr><tr><th>Rating</th><td>8.327</td></tr><tr><th>Vote Count</th><td>171</td></tr><tr><th>Production Companies</th><td>Studio Dragon, IOK Company, Signal Entertainment Group, Ace Factory, CJ ENM</td></tr><tr><th>Popularity</th><td>4.169</td></tr><tr><th>Original Language</th><td>KO</td></tr><tr><th>TV Show ID</th><td>70626</td></tr><tr><th>Homepage</th><td>http://program.tving.com/tvn/stranger</td></tr></table><h3>Cast:</h3><ul class="list-group cast"><li>Cho Seung-woo as Hwang Si-mok</li><li>Bae Doona as Han Yeo-jin</li><li>Lee Jun-hyuk as Seo Dong-jae</li><li>Jeon Hye-jin as Choi Bit</li><li>Choi Moo-seong as Woo Tae-ha</li><li>Yoon Se-a as Lee Yeon-jae</li><li>Park Seong-geun as Kang Won-chul</li><li>Jeon Bae-soo as Choi Yun-soo</li><li>Choi Jae-woong as Jang Geon</li><li>Lee Hae-yeong as Shin Jae-yong</li><li>Song Ji-ho as Park Sun-chang</li><li>Kim Young-jae as Kim Sa-hyun</li><li>Kim Hak-seon as Oh Ju-seon</li><li>Jung Sung-il as Managing Director Park</li><li>Yoon Tae-in as Seo Sang-won</li></ul><h3>Credits:</h3><ul class="list-group crew"><li>Park Hyeon-seok - Director</li><li>Lee Soo-yeon - Screenplay</li><li>Kim Jun-seok - Original Music Composer</li><li>Jung Se-rin - Original Music Composer</li><li>Yu Je-won - Assistant Director</li></ul>
