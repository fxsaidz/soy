Each daughter, though famous for her beauty and wit, comes with unique quirks: the eldest, Shou Hua, has no interest in remarrying after early widowhood; the third, Kang Ning, is fierce and headstrong; the fourth, Hao De, is well-meaning but blunt; and the youngest, Le Shan, is spoiled and selective.  Challenges abound as they face unexpected setbacks, including a cold reception from the already-married sister they came to visit. As the family reestablishes their business, they navigate a series of humorous and heartwarming misadventures, ultimately finding love and fulfilling their mother’s hopes in this lively tale of family and romance.</div><h3>TV Show Details:</h3><table class="table table-bordered details"><tr><th>Name</th><td>Perfect Match</td></tr><tr><th>Original Name</th><td>五福临门</td></tr><tr><th>First Air Date</th><td>2025-01-25</td></tr><tr><th>Last Air Date</th><td>2025-02-09</td></tr><tr><th>Episode Runtime</th><td>50 min</td></tr><tr><th>Genre</th><td>Drama</td></tr><tr><th>Status</th><td>Returning Series</td></tr><tr><th>Production Countries</th><td>China</td></tr><tr><th>Origin Countries</th><td>CN</td></tr><tr><th>Spoken Languages</th><td>zh</td></tr><tr><th>Rating</th><td>8.3</td></tr><tr><th>Vote Count</th><td>11</td></tr><tr><th>Production Companies</th><td>Huanyu Film and Television</td></tr><tr><th>Popularity</th><td>3036.507</td></tr><tr><th>Original Language</th><td>ZH</td></tr><tr><th>TV Show ID</th><td>254821</td></tr><tr><th>Homepage</th><td>https://www.mgtv.com/h/617394.html</td></tr></table><h3>Cast:</h3><ul class="list-group cast"><li>Lu Yuxiao as Kang Ning</li><li>Wang Xingyue as Chai An</li><li>Ni Hongjie as Madame Li</li><li>Liu Xiening as Shou Hua</li><li>Chen Heyi as Du Yangxi</li><li>Wu Xuanyi as Fu Hui</li><li>Huang Shengchi as Fan Lianghan</li><li>Ke Ying as Hao De</li><li>Liang Yongqi as Shen Huizhao</li><li>Huangyang Tiantian as Le Shan</li><li>Winwin as Yang Xian</li><li>Zhao Qing as Chunlai</li><li>Ling Meishi as Qiongnu</li><li>Mi Jin as Deqing</li></ul><h3>Credits:</h3><ul class="list-group crew"><li>Yu Zheng - Producer</li><li>Li Xiuzhen - Producer</li></ul>
