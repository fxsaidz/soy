Thankfully, Li Zan, a Chinese explosive engineer who volunteered in the East Country, was able to save her. After multiple interactions, Li Zan discovered that despite appearing weak on the outside, Song Ran was brave, strong, and full of justice and kindness. The same ideals and compatible souls ignited the love between them.

A sudden bombing attack ended their budding relationship, and they fell into a trough of life after returning to China and even losing contact with each other. By chance, they came across each other again, and gradually, their lives got back on track. Together, they planted the seeds of the white olive tree.</div><h3>TV Show Details:</h3><table class="table table-bordered details"><tr><th>Name</th><td>The White Olive Tree</td></tr><tr><th>Original Name</th><td>白色橄榄树</td></tr><tr><th>First Air Date</th><td>2025-02-01</td></tr><tr><th>Last Air Date</th><td>2025-02-09</td></tr><tr><th>Episode Runtime</th><td>45 min</td></tr><tr><th>Genre</th><td>Drama</td></tr><tr><th>Status</th><td>Returning Series</td></tr><tr><th>Production Countries</th><td>China</td></tr><tr><th>Origin Countries</th><td>CN</td></tr><tr><th>Spoken Languages</th><td>zh, en</td></tr><tr><th>Rating</th><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><th>Vote Count</th><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>Production Companies</th><td>iQIYI</td></tr><tr><th>Popularity</th><td>1594.004</td></tr><tr><th>Original Language</th><td>ZH</td></tr><tr><th>TV Show ID</th><td>252774</td></tr><tr><th>Homepage</th><td>https://www.iq.com/album/the-white-olive-tree-2024-vqdotbl9yl</td></tr></table><h3>Cast:</h3><ul class="list-group cast"><li>Chen Zheyuan as Li Zan</li><li>Liang Jie as Song Ran</li><li>Wang Tianchen as Benjamin</li><li>Gu Zicheng as Sasin</li><li>Zheng Yingchen as Shen Bei</li><li>Liu Yongxi as Pei Xiaonan</li><li>Ding Yizhi as Luo Zhan</li></ul><h3>Credits:</h3><ul class="list-group crew"><li>Chen Xueran - Original Music Composer</li><li>Hai Tao - Director</li><li>Han Hao - Producer</li><li>Yang Qianzi - Screenplay</li><li>Huang Chun - Co-Director</li><li>Jiu Yuexi - Novel</li><li>Han Hao - Screenplay</li><li>Yang Bei - Executive Producer</li><li>Wang Xiaohui - Supervising Producer</li><li>Yu Gong - Producer</li><li>Zhaonan Wang - Script Supervisor</li></ul>
